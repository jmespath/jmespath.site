JMESPath Compliance Tests
=========================

The JMESPath compliance test suite is a way to ensure parity amongst libraries.
It's also way an easy to get started implementing JMESPath in your language of
choice, though be sure to check out :doc:`libraries` to make sure there isn't
already a JMESPath library in your preferred language.
